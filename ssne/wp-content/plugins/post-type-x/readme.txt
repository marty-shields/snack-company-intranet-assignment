== Description ==

Post Type X is a free WordPress plugin that allows you to manage and display your X catalog. Replace the X with whatever you need to catalog e.g. flowers, houses, boats, mixed products, services, portfolio. 

= Built with WordPress =

Post Type X is build with WordPress functions to provide maximum compatibility with other plugins. Custom post types and custom taxonomies are used for items and categories.

= Total output control =
The admin has complete control on the plugin output with fully customisable templates and dozens of shortcodes.

The catalog items can be categorized with hierarchical categories.

Post Type X as full of WordPress hooks is extremely customizable and extensible.

= User Friendly Design =

= Modularity Philosophy =

You will never need to do any workaround to disable not needed functionality. Post Type X is built to be extended.

= Customizable dashboard =

Post Type X lets you name your catalog to give the admin a personalized feeling.

= Display Items with a Shortcode =

Use the shortcode to show items whenever needed on the website. Just paste on any page: [show_products] and watch all items in place of the shortcode.

To show items from just one category, use: [show_products category="2"] where 2 is category ID (it's possible to display several categories by inserting comma separated IDs). 

To display items by IDs, use: [show_products product="5"], where 5 is item ID.

__1. Item Categories__ - show all item categories in CSS customisable list. The widget has also several customisation settings.

__2. Item Search__ - generates a search form that allows to search the items in the catalog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Post Type X and eCommerce Product Catalog? =

Post Type X is a simple and extensible base on which you can built your deeply customized product catalog, services list, portfolio etc. It has only basic features. While developing eCommerce Product Catalog we realized that many users are trying to disable some functionality because they don't need it. That's why we came up with Post Type X which can be extended but it doesn't force any functionality.

Post Type X and eCommerce Product Catalog share the same base so you can switch between them without loosing configuration, products and categories.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of impleCode Post Type X, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Post Type X” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found Post Type X plugin you can view details about it such as the the rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our item catalog plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the plugin pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
